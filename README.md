A:Description

The presented career chatbot helps students figure out which career they should look into based on user input
This offloads strain from the career advisor
By leveraging the power of AI, human resources can be put to better use

B:Other Works

I made use of https://thebotplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Whitepaper-Eight-Features-You-Need-For-Your-First-Bot.pdf
which showed me how to personalize messages
When the user first interacts, it asks for their name
When responding it gives back the name for personalization

C: JOB TYPES

I have selected these 5 computing jobs for CS graduates:
Computer Hardware Engineer
Software Engineer
Computer and Information Research Scientist
IT Product Manager
Computer Science Professor

D: TRAINING

Training cases were assessed through trial and error
I made good use of pandorabots "edit" feature within the chat window
This generated a bit of AIML syntax which helped me understand how to better form further test cases
Often times people short-hand responses. I imagined likely short-hands and made these into categories to enable better usability

E: OPTIMIZATION

This essentially follows suit with the training workflow. I made use of the built-in functionality that allowed me to generate the AIML
From here I was able to easily identify short-hand responses that were to be commonly used.

F: INSTALLATION MANUAL

Create an account on pandorbots.com
Once you are logged in, choose the option to "create bot"
Name the bot as you like
From the "content" section, choose "import from Github"
Click the "create bot" button
Click the "Select Repo by URL" button
Paste "https://github.com/boredomdenied/chatbot2020" into the Githubt Repository URL textbox
Click the "Import Files" button
Click the "Import" button
Click the "Done" button

The bot is now available on the site in the botton right corner with full functionality

G: EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BOT

Seeing as the options selected are for popular and top CS career options, the bot should be quite effective in serving it's purpose
Logs are available from the service at pandoarbots and can be reglarly checked to ascertain the users ineractions or issues for further imporvements

H: CHALLENGES DURING DEVELOPMENT

I faced a few issues with the service. The push to github feature only showed the first twenty repos, and since I have many and my original name started with "W" it didn't show
Simply modifying the name to start with "C" fixed this issue. In the beginning I didn't understand AIML though the tutorial section got me up to speed swiftly

I: THE BOT DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

The service used is a 3rd party option. You do get free features though could run into a constraint and need to pay at some point in the future
Something else to consider is you do't control the service and the hardware it runs out. Outages could see upset customers and you could have no means of getting things back online on your own
A good alternative would be to use your own interpreter. I found program-y which is an open source project with a python interpreter. I plan on using this for further AIML projects
